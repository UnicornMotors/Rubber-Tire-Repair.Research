>Rubber cement forms a strong, semi-permanent adhesive layer between two surfaces, while vulcanizing cement is a specialized chemical adhesive designed to chemically fuse a patch to a rubber item (like a bicycle inner tube or tire), creating a permanently bonded, air- and moisture-proof repair. Vulcanizing cement contains raw rubber and accelerators that cause a chemical reaction, softening the rubber surface and creating a true, seamless fusion between the patch and the item, unlike the simple physical adhesion of regular rubber cement.
